# Predicting Housing Prices

This project is associated with the Applied Machine Learning Scale Course through UC Berkeley's Master of Information & Data Science (MIDS) program. For this project, my group and I participated in the [Housing Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview) Kaggle competition. In this competition, we used a dataset of 1,460 houses sold in Ames, Iowa, from January 2006 through July 2010 to train a model that predicts housing prices. The goal of this project was to utilize feature engineering and regression techniques to accurately predict the price of a house. This project lasted approximately seven weeks from October through December 2021. Our code was written using Jupyter notebooks in Python.

## Repo Structure

This repo includes:
1. Our final Python notebook: predicting_housing_prices.ipynb
2. Our final presentation: Predicting Housing Prices Final Presentation.pdf
3. Other png files for this project, including results.

## Tools & Skills
- Python: sklearn, pandas, TensorFlow
- Development of linear and nonlinear predictive models in machine learning: linear regression (with and without regularization), decision trees, neural networks
- Feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis and data visualization (seaborn, matplotlib)

## Kaggle Competition Results
We had several submissions to the Kaggle competition to test the strength of our models. Our best model was a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree with a root mean squared log error of 0.12996 (72nd percentile of 5,000+ competition entries).
